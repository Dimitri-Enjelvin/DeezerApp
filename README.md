<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


<div align="center">
    <img src="./src/assets/readme/screenshot-home-page.png" alt="Logo" width="600" height="400">
</div>


This is a small project, built in a week using public API such as Deezer API and LastFM API to get data from songs and artists.
I basically started to build it as a test for a job interview and i ended up digging deeper, creating more features and making this small project a real and complete App.
